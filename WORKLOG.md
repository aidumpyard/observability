# BV-OBS-Auto worklog

Newest first. Each entry: what changed, why, how verified. Baseline = `BV-OBS-0`.

## 2026-06-11 — versioning + autonomous setup
- Initialized git, committed the **BV-OBS-0** baseline, tagged it, branched
  **BV-OBS-Auto**. Added `.gitignore`, [AUTO_ROADMAP.md](AUTO_ROADMAP.md), this log.
- Remote `origin` = https://github.com/aidumpyard/observability.git (push target for
  autonomous work). loan_agent remains a separate local repo (same BV-OBS-0 /
  BV-OBS-Auto scheme).
- Verified: `git log`, tag + branch present.

## 2026-06-11 — push blocked (credentials)
- `git push` to origin failed: no gh CLI, no SSH key, no stored PAT (osxkeychain
  empty for github.com). Remote stays configured; autonomous commits accumulate on
  BV-OBS-Auto locally. To enable push: `gh auth login` OR add an SSH key OR store a
  PAT. Will push on next change once auth is present.
